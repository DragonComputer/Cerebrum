# Cerebrum

An implementation of "Crossmodal Supervised Learning Algorithm with Time Series Memory Recording & Long Short-Term Memory Network"

Supported types of perception:

	-  Vision
		- Amodal Perception
		- Color Perception
		- Depth Perception (in Future) (needs Stereoscopic Vision)
		- Form Perception (in Future) (needs Stereoscopic Vision)
		- Relative Velocity Perception (in Future) (needs Stereoscopic Vision)
	-  Hearing
		- Speech Perception
		- Rhythmic Perception
		- Harmonic Perception (in Future) (WARNING: High Complexity)
		- Acceleration Perception (in Future) (needs 2 units of Triple Axis Accelerometer)
	- Touching (Not Yet Available)
		- Mechanic Perception (in Future) (needs lots of Pressure Sensors)
		- Heat & Cooling Perception (in Future) (needs lots of Temperature Sensors)
	- Tasting (Not Yet Available)
		- Solid/Fluid State Chemical Perception (in Future) (WARNING: Sensor Technology Not Available)
	- Smelling (Not Yet Available)
		- Gas State Chemical Perception (in Future) (WARNING: Sensor Technology Not Available)

*Touching, Tasting and Smelling is not yet available. Because of their absence there is a False Reward & Punishment Mechanism*

> Cerebrum's purpose is getting continuous data inputs from different types of sensors as
> events, depending on the predefined threshold values and creating a complex time based relations
> between these events in memory and we call that Neural Memory Networking. Lastly creating outputs
> triggered by stimuli that coming from only one perception type.

### Version
0.0.99

### Dependencies

Cerebrum uses a number of open source libraries to do the job:

* [Python 2.7] - a widely used general-purpose, high-level programming language.
* [PyAudio] - provides Python bindings for PortAudio, the cross platform audio API.
* [OpenCV] - (Open Source Computer Vision) is a library of programming functions mainly aimed at real-time computer vision.
* [wave Module] - provides a convenient interface to the WAV sound format.
* [datetime Module] - supplies classes for manipulating dates and times in both simple and complex ways.
* [os.path Module] - the path module suitable for the operating system Python is running on, and therefore usable for local paths.
* [sys Module] - provides access to some variables used or maintained by the interpreter and to functions that interact strongly with the interpreter. It is always available.
* [audioop Module] - operates on sound fragments consisting of signed integer samples 8, 16 or 32 bits wide, stored in Python strings.
* [NumPy] - the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python.
* [multiprocessing Module] - a package that supports spawning processes using an API similar to the threading module.
* [imutils Module] - a series of convenience functions to make basic image processing functions such as translation, rotation, resizing, skeletonization etc.
* [PyQtGraph] - a pure-python graphics and GUI library built on PyQt4 / PySide and numpy
* [PyQt4] - a comprehensive set of Python bindings for Digia's Qt cross platform GUI toolkit.
* [time Module] - provides various time-related functions.
* [argparse Module] - makes it easy to write user-friendly command-line interfaces.
* [os Module] - provides a portable way of using operating system dependent functionality.
* [subprocess Module] - allows you to spawn new processes, connect to their input/output/error pipes, and obtain their return codes.
* [random Module] - pseudo-random number generators for various distributions.

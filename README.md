# SpectrumEngine

An implementation of "Sense oriented General Reinforcement Learning Algorithm with Time Series Data Collection & Analysis"

Supported senses:

	-  Vision
	-  Hearing

> SpectrumEngine's purpose is getting continous data inputs from different types of sensors as
> an event, depending on the threshold values and creating a complex time based relations
> between these events in memory. Lastly creating outputs triggered by stimulant listeners.

### Version
0.0.27

### Tech

SpectrumEngine uses a number of open source technologies to analysis & synthesis:

* [Python] - a widely used general-purpose, high-level programming language.
* [PyAudio] - provides Python bindings for PortAudio, the cross platform audio API.
* [OpenCV] - (Open Source Computer Vision) is a library of programming functions mainly aimed at real-time computer vision.

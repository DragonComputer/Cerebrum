# SpectrumEngine

An implementation of "General Purpose Multisensorial Supervised (& Reinforcement) Learning Algorithm with Time Series Memory Recording & Neural Memory Networking"

Supported types of perception:

	-  Vision
		- Amodal Perception
		- Color Perception
		- Depth Perception (in Future) (needs Stereoscopic Vision)
		- Form Perception (in Future) (needs Stereoscopic Vision)
		- Relative Velocity Perception (in Future) (needs Stereoscopic Vision)
	-  Hearing
		- Speech Perception
		- Rhythmic Perception
		- Harmonic Perception (in Future) (WARNING: High Complexity)
		- Acceleration Perception (in Future) (needs 2 units of Triple Axis Accelerometer)
	- Touching (Not Yet Available)
		- Mechanic Perception (in Future) (needs lots of Pressure Sensors)
		- Heat & Cooling Perception (in Future) (needs lots of Temperature Sensors)
	- Tasting (Not Yet Available)
		- Solid/Fluid State Chemical Perception (in Future) (WARNING: Sensor Technology Not Available)
	- Smelling (Not Yet Available)
		- Gas State Chemical Perception (in Future) (WARNING: Sensor Technology Not Available)
	- *Abstract Reward & Punishment Mechanism*

> SpectrumEngine's purpose is getting continuous data inputs from different types of sensors as
> an event, depending on the threshold values and creating a complex time based relations
> between these events in memory. Lastly creating outputs triggered by a stimulant that
> coming from a single sense.

### Tech

SpectrumEngine uses a number of open source technologies to analysis & synthesis:

* [Python 2.7] - a widely used general-purpose, high-level programming language.
* [PyAudio] - provides Python bindings for PortAudio, the cross platform audio API.
* [OpenCV] - (Open Source Computer Vision) is a library of programming functions mainly aimed at real-time computer vision.

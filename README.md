	- Emotion (Not Yet Available)
		- Activation - Pleasant : Alerted, Excited, Elated, Happy
		- Pleasant - Deactivation : Contented, Serene, Relaxed, Calm
		- Deactivation - Unpleasant : Fatigued, Bored, Depressed, Sad
		- Unpleasant - Activation : Upset, Stressed, Nervous, Tense
 - Crossmodal: Defines time based relations between the types of perceptions
 - NeuralNet: Multiple Neural Network interconnects the parts of The Cerebrum
	 - Current Speech Sequence to Current Visual Sequence
	 - Current Speech Sequence to Next Speech Sequence
	 - Current Visual Sequence to Current Speech Sequence
	 - Current Vİsual Sequence to Next Visual Sequence
	 - Current Speech Sequence to Text Sequence

*For Multisensorial Part technological advancements are insufficient, currently. Because of this deficiency, there should be a False Reward & Punishment Mechanism for Reinforcement Learning*

> Cerebrum's purpose is getting continuous data inputs from different types of perceptions in real time as
> memory sequences that triggered according to predefined threshold values and creating complex time
> based relations between those memories by Crossmodal logic and training multiple Artificial
> Neural Networks with this extracted data. Lastly creating outputs triggered by a stimuli, using
> pre-trained Artificial Neural Networks. - *Mehmet Mert Yıldıran*

### Version
0.1.74

### Installation

Install RethinkDB:

```Shell
source /etc/lsb-release && echo "deb http://download.rethinkdb.com/apt $DISTRIB_CODENAME main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/rethinkdb.list
wget -qO- https://download.rethinkdb.com/apt/pubkey.gpg | sudo apt-key add -
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install rethinkdb
```

Watch data flow (optional) - <http://localhost:8080>

Install Cerebrum:

```Shell
sudo apt-get install python-pyaudio python-opencv python-scipy python-qt4
sudo pip install cerebrum
```

### Usage

Train with files:

```Shell
cerebrum --video PATH_TO_VIDEO_FILE --audio PATH_TO_AUDIO_FILE --captions PATH_TO_CAPTIONS_FILE
```

Example:

```Shell
cerebrum --video trainingData/Can\ You\ Make\ Someone\ Fall\ In\ Love\ With\ You-7_w_EA4u6oQ.mp4 --audio trainingData/Can\ You\ Make\ Someone\ Fall\ In\ Love\ With\ You-7_w_EA4u6oQ.wav --captions trainingData/Can\ You\ Make\ Someone\ Fall\ In\ Love\ With\ You-7_w_EA4u6oQ.en.vtt
```

Train with your cam (Not recommended):

```Shell
cerebrum --video 0 --audio 0
```

*On the first run Cerebrum will start with a few more seconds delay.*

### Dependencies

Cerebrum uses a number of open source libraries to do the job:

* [Python 2.7] - a widely used general-purpose, high-level programming language.
* [RethinkDB] - is the open-source, scalable database that makes building realtime apps dramatically easier.
* [PyAudio] - provides Python bindings for PortAudio, the cross platform audio API.
* [OpenCV] - (Open Source Computer Vision) is a library of programming functions mainly aimed at real-time computer vision.
* [wave Module] - provides a convenient interface to the WAV sound format.
* [datetime Module] - supplies classes for manipulating dates and times in both simple and complex ways.
* [os.path Module] - the path module suitable for the operating system Python is running on, and therefore usable for local paths.
* [sys Module] - provides access to some variables used or maintained by the interpreter and to functions that interact strongly with the interpreter. It is always available.
* [audioop Module] - operates on sound fragments consisting of signed integer samples 8, 16 or 32 bits wide, stored in Python strings.
* [NumPy] - the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python.
* [multiprocessing Module] - a package that supports spawning processes using an API similar to the threading module.
* [imutils Module] - a series of convenience functions to make basic image processing functions such as translation, rotation, resizing, skeletonization etc.
* [PyQtGraph] - a pure-python graphics and GUI library built on PyQt4 / PySide and numpy
* [PyQt4] - a comprehensive set of Python bindings for Digia's Qt cross platform GUI toolkit.
* [time Module] - provides various time-related functions.
* [argparse Module] - makes it easy to write user-friendly command-line interfaces.
* [os Module] - provides a portable way of using operating system dependent functionality.
* [subprocess Module] - allows you to spawn new processes, connect to their input/output/error pipes, and obtain their return codes.
* [random Module] - pseudo-random number generators for various distributions.
* [pysrt Module] - SubRip (.srt) subtitle parser and writer
* [itertools Module] - implements a number of iterator building blocks inspired by constructs from APL, Haskell, and SML. Each has been recast in a form suitable for Python
